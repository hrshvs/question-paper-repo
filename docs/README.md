# GitHub Pages Website

This directory contains the GitHub Pages website for the IISER Mohali Question Paper Repository.

## How it works

1. **`generate-tree.js`** - A Node.js script that scans the repository and generates `data.json` with the folder structure
2. **`index.html`** - The main HTML page that displays the folder tree
3. **`styles.css`** - CSS styling for the website
4. **`script.js`** - JavaScript that loads and renders the folder tree dynamically
5. **`data.json`** - Generated JSON file containing the folder structure (auto-generated by GitHub Actions)

## Auto-deployment

The website is automatically built and deployed on every push to the main branch using GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`).

The workflow:

1. Checks out the repository
2. Runs `generate-tree.js` to create the latest folder structure
3. Deploys the `docs/` directory to GitHub Pages

## Local testing

To test the website locally:

```bash
# Generate the folder structure
cd docs
node generate-tree.js

# Serve the website (use any static file server)
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
