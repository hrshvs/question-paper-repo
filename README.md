# question-paper-repo

Archive of question papers and exercise sheets from IISER Mohali courses. Collected by students over several years. Expect mixed quality (some scans aren’t OCR’d; some files aren’t PDFs).

Always prefer to use the webiste for viewing and uploading files. The git methods are for advanced users who want to keep a local copy or contribute via CLI.  
The link to [the website](https://iiserm.github.io/question-paper-repo/):

For an older archive, see the [course files mirror](https://iiserm.github.io/course_files/).
For more resources, Studocu hosts additional material: [IISER Mohali on Studocu](https://www.studocu.com/in/institution/indian-institute-of-science-education-and-research-mohali/30483).
