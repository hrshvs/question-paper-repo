Please go through it once. 
 I will not ask any question from SVM, but you should know what is happening in SVM at back. It is very straightforward concept.

Please read from Neuron,  Activation function, ReLU, Leaky ReLU, Softmax. 
I am trying to see if I can explain this lecture, but my last minute urgent travel has messed up the schedule. Otherwise I was thinking of having class today for it. 

>>> I will only ask questions from Neuron (which is simple and straightforward). 

>>> For SVM, no question will be asked (it is for your practice and knowledge).
