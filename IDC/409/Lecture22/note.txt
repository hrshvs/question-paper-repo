----- Some libraries we talked in the class ----

SciPy,  Easy to use, integrated in the scientific stack

   scipy.optimize.minimize

CVXPY for convex NL programs . If it’s not convex/DCP-compliant, it will refuse to solve.

Pyomo (+ IPOPT) very flexible modeling for nonconvex NLP (and MIP, MINLP). 

Pyomo is an algebraic modeling language that lets one define  optimization problem with Python objects (variables, objectives,
constraints) in a natural, mathematical way. But remember it then calls a separate
solver to find the solution.
For non-linear problems, it commonly interfaces with powerful open-source solvers like (a state-of-the-art interior-point optimizer) and .


CasADi symbolic/automatic differentiation + IPOPT; good if one need fasts/accurate derivatives or dynamic optimization.


Symbolic framework with automatic differentiation.

Also worth knowing: NLopt, GEKKO 

NLopt is not a single algorithm but a library that provides a
common interface to a large number of different optimization algorithms,
both open-source and proprietary. 
Huge collection of diverse algorithms.
